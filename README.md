What is React.js?&nbsp;

React is an open-source JavaScript library that is primarily used for building user interfaces in web applications. Developed and maintained by Facebook, React has gained immense popularity in the web development community for its efficiency, flexibility, and declarative approach to building UI components. In summary, React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces that offers a component-based architecture, declarative syntax, virtual DOM, and a strong community of developers. It has become a go-to choice for creating modern and interactive web applications, and its principles and concepts have influenced the broader landscape of web development.

Reasoning on choosing this topic&nbsp;

There are several compelling reasons why I have chosen React as the topic for my research. Firstly, among all the programming languages and technologies I've encountered during my time at SAIT, JavaScript stood out as one of my favorites. I found great enjoyment in the web development classes, which laid the foundation for my fascination with the JavaScript ecosystem.

Another significant factor influencing my choice is my upcoming Capstone project. I've decided to dive deep into React for this project, intending to gain hands-on experience with this technology. This decision serves a dual purpose; not only will I acquire practical skills, but I'll also explore the underlying logic and rich history of React. It's an opportunity to consolidate my knowledge while simultaneously gaining new insights.

Furthermore, Reacts prominence in the software development industry cannot be overlooked. It has evolved to become one of the most influential and widely adopted technologies, powering countless web applications and user interfaces.

In a field as dynamic as technology, being well-versed in React is an asset that opens doors to a multitude of opportunities and ensures my relevance in the ever-evolving world of software development.

Learning

Now that I have gotten all of that all of the way, I am going to dive deep into how I learned how to code using React and what I created.&nbsp;

To kickstart my journey into React, I decided to go back to basics and hone my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I wanted to make sure I had a solid foundation before delving into more advanced concepts. For this purpose, I followed a helpful video tutorial, which you can find here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfAl9bwzVZk

In addition to the video tutorial, I embarked on several side projects to practice and reinforce my skills. This hands-on approach not only solidified my knowledge but also ensured that I was well-prepared to dive into the world of React. It's essential to have a strong grasp of the fundamentals before venturing into more complex technologies like React, and this process helped me do just that.

Once I felt confident in my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills, I eagerly embarked on my journey to learn React. I found a comprehensive program that I followed, available at this repository:https://github.com/flashohq/open-source-react-courses. While I didn't have enough time to complete every aspect of the program, I diligently covered enough ground to empower me to work independently and start creating my own small projects.

This resource allowed me to grasp the essentials of React and provided me with the knowledge and tools needed to bring my ideas to life. Learning React can be a challenging but incredibly rewarding experience, and with the foundation I built, I was well on my way to making my mark with this powerful technology.

Implementation&nbsp;

I decided to create a simple scheduler to demonstrate how effective React is. I leveraged the combined power of Material-UI and TypeScript to craft a small but impactful React project. Material-UI's comprehensive library of pre-designed components made it a breeze to create a visually appealing and responsive user interface. This not only saved me valuable development time but also ensured a polished and consistent design. TypeScript, on the other hand, provided the benefits of strong static typing, helping catch potential errors during development and enhancing code maintainability. I ended up using TypeScript instead of JavaScript for this because it actually worked much better for making real time programs such as a scheduler. By merging these two technologies, I was able to build a React project that not only looked great but also delivered a robust, error-resistant user experience. The seamless integration of Material-UI and TypeScript opened up a world of possibilities and enabled me to bring my project to life with efficiency and confidence.&nbsp;

What is Material UI?&nbsp;

Material-UI is a popular and widely used open-source user interface framework for building web applications using React. It's based on Google's Material Design principles, which provide a set of design guidelines and visual cues for creating modern and aesthetically pleasing user interfaces. Material-UI offers a rich collection of pre-designed and customizable components, such as buttons, forms, navigation bars, and more, that follow these Material Design principles. These components are not only visually appealing but also highly functional and responsive, making it easier for developers to create interactive and user-friendly web applications.

Material-UI is known for its flexibility and ease of integration with React projects. Developers can use these components as building blocks to quickly prototype and design applications, saving time and effort in the UI development process. Additionally, Material-UI supports theming, allowing developers to customize the look and feel of their applications to match their specific branding or design preferences. This framework has gained popularity in the React community due to its robust features, active development, and a large and supportive user base. Whether you're creating a simple web app or a complex enterprise-level application, Material-UI can streamline the UI development process and help you achieve a polished and modern design.

What is TypeScript?&nbsp;

TypeScript is a statically typed, open-source programming language developed by Microsoft. It is a superset of JavaScript, meaning that all valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code. What sets TypeScript apart is its added layer of static typing, which allows developers to catch errors in their code at compile-time rather than runtime. Here are some key aspects of TypeScript:

Static Typing: TypeScript introduces a strong static typing system, which means that variables, parameters, and return values are all explicitly typed. This helps detect type-related errors during development, reducing the likelihood of runtime errors and improving code quality.

Enhanced Tooling: TypeScript provides excellent tooling support, including code editors like Visual Studio Code and a wide range of plugins for other popular code editors. These tools offer autocompletion, type checking, and other features that enhance productivity and code quality.

Readability and Maintainability: By explicitly specifying types, TypeScript code is often more self-documenting and easier to understand, making it beneficial for collaboration and long-term maintenance of projects.

ECMAScript Compatibility: TypeScript maintains compatibility with the latest ECMAScript standards. This means you can leverage the newest JavaScript features, and TypeScript will transpile them into older versions of JavaScript for broader browser compatibility.

Type Inference: TypeScript also offers type inference, which allows developers to omit explicit type annotations in many cases. The TypeScript compiler can deduce types based on how variables and functions are used.

Interfaces and Generics: TypeScript supports the use of interfaces and generics to create reusable and type-safe code structures, which is particularly useful for creating libraries and frameworks.

Compile-Time Checks: TypeScript checks for type errors at compile time, which can help identify and resolve issues before the code is executed in a browser or Node.js environment. This leads to more robust and predictable code.

Large Ecosystem: TypeScript has a growing and active community, and it's widely adopted in web development, making it an excellent choice for both small and large projects.

Developers often choose TypeScript when building complex or mission-critical applications where type safety and maintainability are crucial. It's particularly well-suited for projects using frameworks like Angular or React, as it helps catch errors early in the development process and improves the overall quality of code.




Examples of code from my project

If you decide not to run my program for myself I will provide some examples of my code and its functions here&nbsp;

Index.tsx

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root") as HTMLElement); root.render( <react.strictmode> <cssbaseline> <app> </app></cssbaseline></react.strictmode> );

This code sets up the entry point for a React application, initializes the root element, and renders the&nbsp;App component as the starting point for the user interface. The use of React.StrictMode and CssBaseline ensures a well-structured and styled application.

App.tsx

import { Scheduler } from "./lib";
import { EVENTS } from "./events";
import { useRef } from "react";
import { SchedulerRef } from "./lib/types";

function App() {
&nbsp; const calendarRef = useRef<schedulerref>(null);




&nbsp; return (
&nbsp; &nbsp; <scheduler  ="" ref="{calendarRef}" events="{EVENTS}">
&nbsp; );
}

export default App;

This React component, named App, imports and uses the Scheduler component from the "./lib" module, and it also imports an array of EVENTS from a separate module called "events". Within the App component, a useRef hook is used to create a reference to the Scheduler component, which is named calendarRef. This reference will allow interaction with the Scheduler component from within the App.

The App component then returns the Scheduler component, passing in the following props:

ref={calendarRef}: This prop attaches the calendarRef reference to the Scheduler component, enabling access to the Scheduler component's methods and properties.
events={EVENTS}: This prop provides the EVENTS array, which contains a list of scheduled events, to be displayed in the Scheduler.
Event.ts

import { ProcessedEvent } from "./lib/types";

export const EVENTS: ProcessedEvent[] = [
&nbsp; {
&nbsp; &nbsp; event_id: 1,
&nbsp; &nbsp; title: "Gym workout",
&nbsp; &nbsp; start: new Date(new Date(new Date().setHours(9)).setMinutes(0)),
&nbsp; &nbsp; end: new Date(new Date(new Date().setHours(10)).setMinutes(30)),
&nbsp; },
&nbsp; {
&nbsp; &nbsp; event_id: 2,
&nbsp; &nbsp; title: "Dentist appointment",
&nbsp; &nbsp; start: new Date(new Date(new Date().setHours(12)).setMinutes(0)),
&nbsp; &nbsp; end: new Date(new Date(new Date().setHours(13)).setMinutes(0)),
&nbsp; &nbsp; admin_id: 2,
&nbsp; &nbsp; color: "#50b500",
&nbsp; },
&nbsp; {
&nbsp; &nbsp; event_id: 3,
&nbsp; &nbsp; title: "Work",
&nbsp; &nbsp; start: new Date(new Date(new Date().setHours(14)).setMinutes(0)),
&nbsp; &nbsp; end: new Date(new Date(new Date().setHours(22)).setMinutes(0)),
&nbsp; },
&nbsp;&nbsp;
];

The provided code is an array of ProcessedEvent objects, which represents a list of scheduled events. Each event includes properties like event_id, title, start (start time), and end (end time). These events are defined with specific time intervals, making them ideal for use in applications that involve scheduling, calendar management, or time-based planning. The code also demonstrates the usage of new Date() to set the start and end times for each event, with some events having additional properties like admin_id and color. I could have created some backend here and made a database and make these as objects but that was not my goal for this project so I have left it simple like this.
